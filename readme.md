# Plex Metadata Configurer

Update season and episode information (title, description, thumbnail, etc) for **unwatched** episodes within a single library.

The library must be configured to use the `tv.plex.agents.none` Agent, otherwise the agent and this app would both be trying to set the metadata (differently).

## Problem

Is this you?

> My DVR recordings of Sports! events don't fit neatly into Plex's naming schemes, but I've found a way to make it work by creating a new "show" for each year, and then a new "season" for each weekend/event, then each "episode" is the different events throughout that weekend! Which works! ..But I have to go into the Plex web UI and rename each season and episode individually, because your Plex library either has no agent (`tv.plex.agents.none`) or the wrong agent. ...And then, that time I lost my library (not the actual media files, just the Plex metadata!), and... Yeah, I had to re-do it all...

As rambled: I have a pretty specific show/season/episode scheme that's working well for me, but getting the metadata for it set in Plex is a bit of a PITA. 

There's the [.plexmatch](https://support.plex.tv/articles/plexmatch/) solution for placing a configuration file alongside your content, in each show's directory, but that only helps the agent identify it and then populate whatever metadata it has.

I probably should have looked into how to build a custom agent. But instead: THIS!

## Background & Attribution
Early on I found my way to [Plex custom season title script](https://web.archive.org/web/20230102221830/https://pastebin.com/qMVCp4Cv), a solution in Python for renaming your season titles based on part of the directory name, and [Python-PlexAPI](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi) the package it uses to do the Plexy bits. They've both provided some insights and inspiration.

The (unofficial?) docs available at ["M-C"'s Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/fyvekatz/m-c-s-public-workspace/request/6gfy9hu/update-movie-details) and [Plexopedia](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/api/library/details/) have been very helpful. Special shout-out to [rare PUT docs](https://www.postman.com/fyvekatz/m-c-s-public-workspace/request/6gfy9hu/update-movie-details)

And special thanks/curses to LukeHagar's [plex-api-spec](https://github.com/LukeHagar/plex-api-spec) and its (autogenerated?) [plexcsharp](https://github.com/LukeHagar/plexcsharp), which gave me the initial optimism of "Oh, I can just toss together a little script in Program.cs using this package, this'll be easy". If you do want to explore his solution, be mindful of [at least this bug](https://github.com/LukeHagar/plexcsharp/issues/10). His projects have been immensely helpful in writing my own solution that doesn't use it.

I wasn't able to wrap my head around the `plexcsharp` API, and turned to just trying out the REST requests it documents. The responses from my Plex server were great: a pretty pleasant REST API! I was poking around there for awhile, trying to understand `plexcsharp`, when I decided to drop the dependency and greenfield it with a new project that makes just the REST requests I care about. The project scope grows.

## Current State

1. Connects to your Plex server's REST API, using an auth token
	- see https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/
	- these tokens are temporary, and will expire after an unspecified time
2. Navigates your Plex server to find the configured library, then finds all **unwatched** episodes and the seasons and shows they're in
3. Looks for a `.plexmeta` file in the season directory, and loads intended metadata from it for the season and each episode.
	- if this file doesn't exist, or doesn't contain a Title for either the season or any episodes, a Title value will attempt to be parsed from the episode filename
4. Uses your Plex server's REST API to update the title of seasons and episodes

## Short Term Objectives
- Refactor app configuration, shouldn't need to change `Config.cs` and re-compile the app
	- read from (in order of precedence/priority): command line args, environment variables, a config file
	- once done, follow "Getting a New Token" at https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/ , and don't put the new one in the repo this time
- setup a basic build pipeline in github

## Long Term Backlog
Grouped by prioritized category. Unordered within category.

1. Bugs
2. Important Features
	- ability to specify thumbnail (and background?) images in config files, and update them through the API
	- switch from user token authentication to https://forums.plex.tv/t/authenticating-with-plex/609370
3. Research
4. Cleanup & Refinement
	- Replace all the `Console` writing with some sort of lightweight logging that can be configured to different sinks? Is there actually a **lightweight** solution?
	- Setup an actual CancellationTokenSource which reacts to the ESC key
5. Unsortables
